# Text-to-SQL-LLM-App
🚀 An End-to-End Text-to-SQL LLM application using Llama, LangChain, and Streamlit. This AI-powered tool converts natural language queries into SQL statements and retrieves results from a database. Ideal for automating SQL queries and making data retrieval seamless!

# 📌 Text-to-SQL LLM App 🚀  

## 🔥 Overview  
This project builds a **Text-to-SQL LLM application** using **Llama, LangChain, and Streamlit**. Users can input natural language questions, and the system translates them into **SQL queries** to retrieve insights from a database.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Llama** – For processing text queries and generating SQL statements  
- **LangChain** – To integrate the LLM with a structured database  
- **Streamlit** – For an interactive web-based UI  
- **SQL Database** – To store and retrieve query results  
- **Pipenv** – For dependency management  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Convert natural language to SQL queries **without manual intervention**  
✔️ Retrieve **insights from the database** effortlessly  
✔️ **LLM-powered** AI automation for data analysis  
✔️ User-friendly **Streamlit web interface**  
✔️ Works with **multiple SQL databases**  

## 🔧 Installation  
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, run:  
```bash
pipenv install
pipenv install streamlit langchain_groq
pipenv shell
```

## 📝 Sample Queries Tested
- What are the average marks class-wise?
- Name of the student who scored the highest marks?
- Name of the student who scored the lowest marks?
- Name of the student with the second highest marks in DEVOPS?
- List students with second highest marks course-wise.
  
## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Support for multiple LLM models
- ✅ Add a visual dashboard for SQL results
- ✅ Implement fine-tuned LLM models for better accuracy
